# eos-companion-app-integration

This repository hosts the OS integration side of the Endless OS Companion App.

If you're looking for the Android App itself, you can find it at
https://github.com/endlessm/android-companion-app

## Building

`eos-companion-app-integration` requires Avahi 0.7 (for GObject-Introspection
bindings to avahi-glib) which is not available in Endless OS. You can get
Avahi 0.7 from http://avahi.org/download/avahi-0.7.tar.gz and configure it
with `./autogen.sh --disable-qt3 --disable-qt4 --disable-pygobject --disable-mono`.

Afterwards, this project is setup in such a way that you should just be able
to use the standard autotools process of
`./autogen.sh --prefix=YOURPREFIX; make; sudo make install`.

## Running

You can start the services with `eos-companion-app-service` which will
automatically register an Avahi service under the name `EOSCompanionAppService`
(or a variant if that name would collide with another local or remote name). It
will also register the `com.endlessm.CompanionAppService` name on the
D-Bus session bus which exports `com.endlessm.CompanionAppService.Service`.
